# Website

Code that is (or will be) used to run my website. It is primarily written in
Java on the backend and simple HTML and CSS with the Qute templating engine for
the frontend. This website is server side rendered for simplicity due to it
being just a simple blog page. Javascript is avoided at all costs.
The application server used is Quarkus. There is also an H2 database used to
keep track of blog states e.g. when what blog was updated etc.

Technology stack:
1. Java
2. Quarkus
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. SQL
